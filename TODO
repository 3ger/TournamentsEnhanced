Make settlement choices for peace tournaments as such:
    -random
    -one per side
    -if can't have for a side then none for that side
    -if cant have for both sides, then none at all
    -do tournaments every go away?
        -if not, allow peace tournament in city that already has one
investigate other tournament logic
pull all TallTales code into separate abstraction layer
full item tooltips in prize selection screen?
companions joining in fights have wrong icon?
add version that requires harmony and modlib
add notification that tournament is happening, and why, to the town description and menu items if possible
Add tiny flag icon to towns with tournament
expire old tournaments?
investigate option to resolve post question (compatibility check or add mod option)
post a questionaire (why did download mod, what like about it, what don't like about it, what new features or ideas do you have, any other comments?)
global and local leaderboards (NOT online leaderboards)
