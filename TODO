WELCOME
-------
Hello! This is my todo list for Tournaments Enhanced.

TEST
----
Write unit tests for existing methods with NUnit, Moq, and Shouldly

FIX
---
Use Bannerlord's .GetRandomElement() or custom deterministic implementation for prize selection
Revamp MCM integration - https://github.com/Aragas/Bannerlord.MBOptionScreen
  -Global and PerCharacter options
    -Is Per-Save better than per-character?
  -ability to reset to defaults
  -all variables tweakable
  -Existing options revamped as well
Donâ€™t offer player-crafted items as reward options
Hide tournament icon after player plays it
Don't allow Highborn tournaments for faction led by player
Show prize selection during hosted tournament
S Don't hide Select Prize button after selecting a prize and ensure reselecting prize keeps same items

RECOMMEND
---------
Try out mods to recommend: pacemaker, houses of calradia and noble titles

IMPROVE
-------
Make individual tournament type spawn chances improve the more days its been since the last
Make Popup at peace time asking player if they want to host a tournament (and where)
if player is wedded hero ask player if they want to host a tournament (and where).
Worsten relations with previous payor if new payor steals their tournament
A payor friendly with another payor may decide not to steal tournament
Make Highborn tournaments different from invitational? or reknown level is only difference?
Ask player to authorize any tournaments happening at player's expense
Charge 2000 upfront cost plus option-configurable scale of cost for prize, and add "host can afford tournament prize" logic
Prize pool is filtered by what the host can afford. Configuration of % of total $ ClanLeaders are willing to spend on tournament prizes. Also configuration of scale of prize cost to host in options.
Simplify logic for finding wedding tournament host settlement

REFACTOR
--------
S remove concept of InitiatingHero and refactor all uses to call HeroFinder instead
s Wrap enums and structs
S Move all numeric constants and magic numbers to separate "default values" constants file for easier tweaking of numbers
S add "best experience" version that requires harmony and mcm
refactor EncounterGameMenuBehavior from BehaviorBase and rename BehaviorBase

INVESTIGATE
-----------
L companions joining in fights have incorrect or missing icon. May be bug in Bannerlord?
M Possible to replace betting logic, allowing bets on others and increased betting limit?

OPTION
------
Make number of companions in tournament configurable (was/is 10)
Make companion selection window, or add criteria or block/allow list of companions that fight in tournament
Make Prosperity tournaments once per 15 or 30 days (configurable)

COMMUNICATE
--------
Update banner and screenshots with photo mode

BUILD
-------------
S delete output folder on build to clean up pdb
S Parameterize SubModule.xml to get version number dynamically
Rewrite project files to allow for dotnet cli usage to remove vs2019 dependency

CREATE
------
SPIKE is jousting feasible?
XL Grand Tournaments, happening every x months, announced to player before it happens 1 month, 2 weeks, 1 week, and when tournament begins
  -What should defining characteristics be? Need high renown to compete? Pay to enter? Noble-worthy prizes? Much larger monetary and social gains?
SM add mod options input to change language
S if language is default option, select language from Bannerlord
M externalize text resources for multilanguage support
Menu to select who comes with you (choose preferred order of companion or spouse or a troop)

SPIKE full item tooltips in prize selection screen? (try ImprovedTooltips mod for examples)

SM Make settlement choice for tournaments as such:
    -random
    -one per side
    -if can't have for a side then none for that side
    -if cant have for both sides, then none at all
    -do tournaments every go away?
        -if not, allow peace tournament in city that already has one

SM add notification that tournament is happening, and why, to the town description and menu items if possible


SM Add tiny flag icon to towns with tournament (see SettlementIcons mod)


M tournament champion "leaderboards" for towns, nations, and empire (or "world") (NOT online leaderboards)

The Travelling Tournament idea: a special party of elite arena fighters travels the world initiating special tier tournaments
  -Must pay fee to enter tournament, since the travellers offer their own reward if non-traveller wins.
